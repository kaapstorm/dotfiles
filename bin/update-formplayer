# This script downloads formplayer.properties and formplayer.jar. Some
# updates require the Formplayer database to be recreated. To do that:
#
#     $ dropdb formplayer -U commcarehq -h localhost
#     $ createdb formplayer -U commcarehq -h localhost
#
# The PostgreSQL password can be found in HQ's localsettings.py in the
# DATABASES dictionary.
